>Is international law real law?

There's no real world government and in actuality, we have limited abilities to enforce international law.

> Example is the US which recently violated NAFTA (Canada, Mexico & US trade agreement) by imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. There is little the Canadian govt. can really do despite the judicial forum outlined in the trade agreement. Historically, the US has disregarded rulings made by the tribunal. This is a matter of power disparity as Canada nor Mexico can realistically impose any substantial punishment.

Powerful countries can choose to disregard international law.

Like in any good bureaucracy, we only hear about international law goes wrong/ is disregarded. 

`Essentially, international law is the best out of a bunch of shitty options.`

We witness intl. law in our economies, travel, etc.

# History

International law dates back to 1625. The founder of our modern understanding of intl. law and sovereign states was a dutch lawyer, **<u>Hugo Grotius</u>**.

## Hugo Grotius

He published 3 books on the law of war and peace. He lived in a time of great discourse between European nations. He wrote about state sovereignty in his first book. He proposed **nation-states** rather than kingdoms (one nation with a shared identity under the rule of the state). International law is a matter of natural law. 

He developed 4 principles which form the **law of nations**.

1. A state/individual cannot attack another state/individual
2. A state/individual cannot take from another state/individual
3. No state/individual shall disregard the contracts of another state/individuals
4. No state/individual shall not commit a crime against another state/individual

He believed if you fight a war, it must be for a virtuous cause and in the interest of the broader community.

If you wage war, you have certain obligations/duties if you're engaged in a just war. 
- Avoid harm to civilians
- Provide medical aid to POWs
- Victory should not mean pillage/plunder

### State Sovereignty

The ability of a country to act however it pleases within its own borders. 

## The Peace of Westphalia

The peace of Westphalia is the first time Hugo's ideas were put into play. The peace of Westphalia is signed in 1648. It brought to an end The 30 Years Wars (1618-1648). Originally began as a religious war and had evolved into a broader power struggle in which majority of Europe partook in.

The peace after the 30 year war brought many changes:
- Sovereignty and territorial changes. 
- The emergence of Dutch provinces as a result of sovereignty.
- Allowed rules to determine the religion of their territories. (Reduces religious conflicts)
- Sets up the idea of a balance of power in Europe. 
- Laid foundations for diplomacy.
- No one country in Europe is so powerful as to dominate and disregard the laws of sovereignty.
- Through diplomacy, you keep the major powers in check.
