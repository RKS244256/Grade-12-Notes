# Methods of Accountability

## Judicial
Treat IHL violations as criminal proceedings. There is no perfect solution to holding violators accountable.
Most proceedings are focused on prosecution rather than remediation for the victims.
### National Courts
Geneva conventions require signatories to suppress and enforce IHL violations via domestic laws within a nation's legal system. Geneva conventions also requires nations must pursue all violators regardless of citizenship nor location of offence (**Universal Jurisdiction**). Generally, these practices do not work well as nations/states are hesitant to try offenders which have nothing to do with their own affairs. Perpetrators are also often from poorer areas and proceedings are criticized for allowing IHL violations to occur and only pursuing offenders after and often for problems which ultimately stem from Western/European colonialism.
### International Courts
### Nuremberg Trials
- Sought to hold German soldiers accountable for various IHL violations. Various soldiers were also tried in National courts. 
- Marked the creation of the international military tribunal by the USSR, USA, Britain, France (the big 4). 
- Heard cases against 22 high ranking Nazi officers.
	- 19/22 were convicted
- Were tried for "crimes against peace", "war crimes", "crimes against humanity"
- By putting officers on trial, the allied forces wanted to show a respect of rule of law.
#### Tokyo Trials
- Sought to hold Japanese soldiers accountable for various IHL violations. 
- Various soldiers were also tried in National courts. 
- The international military tribunal for the far east was established at this time.
- Heard cases against 28 high ranking Japanese officers.
	- 28/28 were convicted
- Were tried for "crimes against peace", "war crimes", "crimes against humanity"
- By putting officers on trial, the allied forces wanted to show a respect of rule of law.
#### Nuremberg Principles
1. Anyone who violates IHL should be responsible and held accountable.
2. Regardless of national laws, violations of IHL will be pursued.
3. Anyone in position of authority who violates IHL in their capacity as a govt. official shall regardless, be held responsible for them.
4. Anyone who carries out a criminal act, will be held responsible regardless of instructions received from superior officers.
5. Anyone charged with IHL violations should be granted the right to a fair trial
6. IHL violations are defined as "crimes against peace", "war crimes", and "crimes against humanity"
7. Participation in any crime under point 6 is considered an IHL violation

#### Criticism
Victors' justice
- No one from the allied forces were tried
- Most egregious overlap was the use of nuclear bomb

#### Ad Hoc Intl. Criminal Tribunals

While ad hoc are successful generally, they fail to prosecute en masse, prompting a need for an established international criminal court.
##### Yugoslavia
- Yugoslavia and throughout the Balkans broke out into a civil/ethnic war.
- Europe and West tried to intervene but failed to prevent war crimes from being committed.
- Tribunal established in the Hague
- Prosecuted crimes dating back to 1991.
- Focused on impacts of war crimes (crimes against humanity and peace) rather than who started it (crimes against peace).
- Set precedent and serve as case law

##### Rwanda Genocide
>**International community failed to prevent genocides but criminal proceedings were pursued.** (*They could intervene but did not*)
- Tribunal established in Tanzania
- Prosecuted crimes dating back to 1994
- Focused on impacts of war crimes (crimes against humanity and peace) rather than who started it (crimes against peace).
-  Set precedent and serve as case law
### Creation of the International Criminal Court
>Different from international court of justice (Civil vs Criminal proceedings)

- Established in 2002
- Only designed to prosecute war crimes
- The US, China, Israel have not joined the ICC for various reasons
> Mostly to avoid following a court which may pursue war crimes committed by their armed forces. They instead rely on internal systems (military court/police). The US in particular listed that their armed forces may not be afforded rights they're granted internally.
- Supporting nations adopted the Statute of ICC (Rome Statute) in Rome, creating the ICC in 1998.
	- Gave 4 years to set up the ICC
	- Had a statute of limitations of inception - present.
- ICC prosecutes war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide
- Does not supersede national courts but rather compliments them
- Referred to as the court of last resort. Catches offenders/cases that could not be pursued in other ways.
### Hybrid Courts
- Used in Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Timor Leste
> In every metric, the living, social, and economic conditions are extremely low in these countries. This makes it hard for testify at the Hague as it would drastically affect their livelihoods.
- Hybrid courts alleviate social barriers by setting up legal courts within countries where war crimes are taking place. 
- May rely on local prosecutors/judges, building trust and credence with local communities.
- Less expensive than bringing people to the Hague
- Has more lasting impact on a national court system
- May be understaffed
- Diverts resources away from other govt. initiatives such as law enforcement, medical, etc

## Non-Judicial

When judicial proceedings are not viable or feasible. Outside of the court of law and are mostly symbolic.

**3 Functions**
1. Reparative
	- Right what was wronged
	>After conflicts in Bosnia, govt. established property and land commissions to grant restitution to individuals. (Reparation)
	>Canadian compensation towards residential school survivors. (Compensation)
	>In 1970, Chancellor of West Germany visited the monument of the Warsaw ghetto uprising (Apologies)
	>Opening archives
	>Don't allow officials of previous regime to work in the current regime
2. Truth-Seeking
	- Seek the truth
	>Truth commissions (investigate violations of IHL and other HR abuses)
	>	Eg. South Africa, Argentina
	>	-Establish cause and accountability
	>	-Allows society to come to terms with their past
	>	-Hear the testimonies of victims, perpetrators and witnesses
	>	-Forums of inquiry, not a trial nor to establish guilt
	>	- Will publish testimony, reports, etc. as part of the govt. record
	>	- Makes recommendations to govt.
3. Reconciliation
	- Bring people together
	>Often extensions of truth commissions
	>Amnesty for truth
	>	Individual perpetrators would not be prosecuted in exchange for full, truthful and complete admission of guilt and testimony
	>	If crimes were not political or you were found not to be fully truthful, you would be ineligible under this policy.

>The focus shifts from perpetrator to victims. Common feature of these functions is to find peace and leave conflict behind.
