![[February 20, 2025 - Ontario Human Rights Code]]

# Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- Influenced Canadian human rights as we see them today.
	- Particularly, its messages about equality are found in the Bill of Rights, Charter, etc.
- John P Humphrey, a Canadian diplomat was a key author of the document.
# Racial Segregation
## Christie v. York
- Christie went to a hockey game, went to a bar nearby, and was refused service due to being Black. 
- Was awarded $200 for damages to his dignity. 
- York Corporation appealed and won as the higher courts determined establishments could serve whomever they wish.
## Real Estate Covenants
- When selling/buying a home, you were required to sign a "real estate covenant"
- As part of the covenant, a homeowner agreed that the property "never be sold, assigned, transferred, leased to, occupied by the Jewish, Hebrew, semitic, Negro, colored race or blood ".
	- Explicitly targeted minority groups and kept home ownership within the white majority.
- SCC abolished this in 1951 but covenants still continued in practice.
# Ontario Racial Discrimination Act
- Passed 1944
- Banned published racial or religious discrimination.
# Human Rights In Ontario
- Despite not having statutes such as Jim Crowe laws, social conventions still perpetuated discrimination.
- Viola Desmond was not arrested for being black or not sitting on the balcony, she was charged for not paying the "tax" for a floor seat.
- In the 1950s, laws were passed in response to civil rights movements and push back by minorities against discriminatory social practices and conventions.
- In 1962, Ontario enacts a human rights code and establishes a human rights commission, a first in Canada.
	- Was based on public consciousness at the time. This means no protection against sexual orientation, women, etc.
	- Only race, creed, color, ancestry, nationality, and place of origin.
		- Very focused on race and not sweeping.
	- Restricted discrimination in published works (signs, flyers, notices), employment, trade union membership, public accommodations, services, and facilities.
	- Expansions included disability, sexual orientation, sex, and family status.
- In the 1980s, the government began acknowledging and addressing systemic discrimination.
- 3 Agencies which collaborate to ensure and enforce human rights:
	1. Ontario Human Rights Commission
	2. Human Rights Tribunal
	3. Human Rights Legal Support Center
## Ontario Human Rights Commission
- Statutory Arms-Length Agency
	- The government funds it but doesn't control it.
	- The government can appoint the commissioner who direct human rights policy in Ontario.
- Promotes human rights using:

	- Legal action to clarify the law or enforce human rights
		- Taking an entity to court
		- Initiating actions at the Human Rights Tribunal

	- Report about the state of human rights
## Human Rights Tribunal
- Quasi-court
- Your rights mean nothing if you cannot take the govt. to court nor if no one hears your case.
- You have your case heard by an adjudicator regarding your human right complaint.
	- Adjudicator may not necessarily be a lawyer nor judge.
- There may be a mediation process prior to the hearing to reach a consensus and avoid cases being unnecessarily heard.
- During a hearing, you provide evidence, examine and cross examine witnesses, etc similar to actual court.
	- These are called quasi-judicial proceedings.
- Hearings are not to determine guilt but to reach a resolution/remedy.
## Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Centre
