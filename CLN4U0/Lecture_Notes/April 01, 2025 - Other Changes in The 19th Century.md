# Importance of the Geneva Convention
- Mitigate the suffering created by war
- All medical personnel and facilities are to be protected
- Wounded soldiers must not be attacked
	- Since they're no longer able to partake in a battle, they are no longer an enemy combatant
- Introduction of the red cross emblem
	- Symbolizes neutrality
	- Anything with this emblem is to not be attacked and should be protected
	- We now use 3 symbols
		- Red Cross
		- Red Crescent
		- Red Crystal
	- Misuse is a violation of the Geneva Conventions
