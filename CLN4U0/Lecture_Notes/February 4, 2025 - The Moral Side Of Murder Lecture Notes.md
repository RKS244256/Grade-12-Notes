# The Trolley Problem

> What's the right thing to do in the trolley problem? Save the 5 at the expense of 1 or save your conscience at the expense of 5? 
> Does a change in circumstances (for example actively pushing a man in front of the train to spare the workers) alter your actions?

The main difference between the fat man and lever variations of the trolley problems are the execution of the choice. The fat man is more personal due to proximity and the action of pushing him. 

**Certain moral principles arise from the Trolley Problem.**

Includes:
- Consequential Moral Reasoning
> Locates the morality in the consequences of an act
> 5 should live at the expense of 1
> A branch is utilitarianism
- Categorical Moral Reasoning
> Locates morality in the act itself based on an absolute moral framework
> Murder is wrong because it's wrong. Consequences be damned.
> Notable philosopher which follows this reasoning is Emmanuel Kant 

Despite the perceived mundanity of philosophy, it confronts the common knowledge and morality we internalize. Skepticism while useful, is meant to inspire change as opposed to make way for sloth.

# Case For Cannibalism

Utilitarianism aims to maximize pleasure and minimize pain within a moral framework.

## The Mignonette

TL;DR, due to a lack of food, a group of shipwrecked men were forced to commit cannibalism to survive. 2 of the men defended themselves using utilitarianism to argue their actions were necessary and therefore permissible.

> Would consent or other factors make an act such a cannibalism permissible?
		Supposed there was a lottery? Would it be permissible?

> Does the net "happiness" matter in spite of the suffering caused?

### Questions Raised

> Do we have fundamental rights which make murder wrong?
> Does a lottery or other "fair" procedure justify any result?
> Does consent itself void any moral failings?
> What is the moral work of consent?
