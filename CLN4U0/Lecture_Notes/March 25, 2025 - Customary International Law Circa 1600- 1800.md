***Previous***: [[March 24, 2025 - History of International Law]]

Over time, nations began to respect the sovereignty of other nations. 

What gives rises to this is the emergence of permanent diplomacy and the establishment of permanent embassies (peaceful interaction between nations rather than the whims of a king). 

Rules of diplomacy also emerge (such as protection of diplomats).

The navigation of the globe and increased international trade also gave reason for stronger maritime law (international waters, freedom of the seas).

International law at this point is customary rather than statute law.

By the end of the 1700s, certain things had changed:
- Protestant-Catholic wars had settled down and religious toleration increased
- The American revolution took place, creating a fracture in the British empire
- Expansion of the British empire in the Americas and the important of maritime law increases
- More codification (treaties, agreements, and customary laws written down)
