# Jeremy Bentham & Utilitarianism

>The highest principle of morality is to maximize and prioritize pleasure over pain. (Maximum utility)

When considering new policy and law, Bentham believes a net utility should be a major if not primary factor.

>A community is a sum of the individuals which comprise it and therefore, the utility of said individuals should determine morality.

A similar train of thought is the idea of cost/benefit analysis in which utility is measured by some value such as happiness or monetary gain.
	-> This is usually subjective as what is a cost or benefit is up to the organizers.
>An example is the Ford Pinto case in which a cost/benefit analysis where $11 per part would avoid explosions due to a ruptured fuel tank. However, this cost "outweighed" the projected prevented casualties (life was valued at $200,000 a piece). 

## Objections
1. Fails to respect individual/minority rights (only considers the whole)
2. Not possible to aggregate all values into a often; monetary, uniform or objective value
		-> Is there a distinction between degrees of pleasure? `A Benthamite would argue no as who's to decide what is more pleasurable or worthy of being valued more?`
>What are the consequences to utilitarianism due to these flaws?

## How To Measure Pleasure?

>Supposed you could stop 9/11 by torturing a suspect? Is it moral/ethical? Would cost/benefit analysis benefit this dilemma?

Going back to previous objections: is the suspect's utility as an individual worth considering? Is it possible to uniformly assign an objective value with degrees of pleasure taking account?

### John Stuart Mill

A later philosopher who sought to address the flaws and objections of utilitarianism. He attempted to humanize utilitarianism. Could it be scaled to humanitarian issues and degrees of pleasure? 

#### Principles And Thoughts
- Our empirical desires are the only thing that matters
- It's possible to draw a distinction between higher and lesser pleasures
	-> Only test is if someone who experiences both enjoys one more than the other without any coercion or influence.
- Justice and individual rights are privileged but not against the utilitarian framework but rather born out of a long term interest of humankind.
