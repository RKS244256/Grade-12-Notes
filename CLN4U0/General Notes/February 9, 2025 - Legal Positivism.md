# Summary Jot Notes
- Originated in the 19th century as a response to the foundations of natural law.
- Law is a human construct and should therefore be separated from morality.
- Jeremy Bentham argues laws are to be assessed based on utility rather than given authority from moral principles.
- John Austin posits law is "the command of the sovereign" and are only given authority based on governing bodies with the power to enforce them.
	- This theory is referred to as the command theory of law.
- H.L.A Hart introduced the concept of **primary** and **secondary rules** and argued laws draw their validity from established rules rather than moral justifications.
	- Primary rules govern behavior.
	- Secondary rules create mechanisms for the creation, modification, and enforcement of laws.
- Legal positivism is present in all aspects of law including constitutional law, administrative law, and legal interpretation.
	- This includes checks and separation of powers as well as procedures to ensure laws are enacted in a legitimate legislative process.
	- Binds legal decisions to predictable law rather than a subjective and constantly shifting morality.
- Also present in international law with the UN Charter and Geneva Conventions grounded in positivist principles.
	- They derive their authority from agreements rather than morality.
- The rigid and absolute separation of law and morality within legal positivism may lead to the legitimization of unjust laws on the basis of government and procedural legitimate.

# Discussion Questions
1. Within legal positivism, individuals should in fact disobey unjust laws. One of legal positivism's guiding principles is that law should be assessed based on their utility and effectiveness. If a law is unjust and does not provide a positive effect for a group and stokes societal unrest as a result, it cannot be considered an effective law under legal positivism and therefore should be disobeyed.
2. Judges should consider the broader social and ethical consequences of their rulings as this situation follows the same vein of logic in the previous question. Laws exist to quell societal unrest under the legal positivist framework and a judge's power to interpret laws as they see fit is also part of the checks and separation of powers employed by many governments to ensure legitimate creation and enforcement of statutes.
3. Legal positivism within an international context has worked to ensure the human rights of many through the UN Charter and Geneva Conventions. However, it has also been used to justify gross acts of injustice perpetrated by governments across the globe. Legal positivism can be used to justify heinous acts but is also used to protect the rights of many. Rather than appealing to an often subjective sense of morality to establish and enforce human rights, legal positivism, through agreements and legislative procedure, pushes for a backing of legitimate and grounded practices to establish human rights. Nevertheless, subjective morality does have a place in law as law often reflects the morals of the general public. Where moral positivism offers critique is in the subjective and often shifting nature of morality, for better or for worse in which case morality should not necessarily be the mode of authority but rather the driving force to enact laws using the authority of procedure, utility, and enforcement.
