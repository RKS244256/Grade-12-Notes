# What is it?
The **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination** was adopted in 1965 and put into effect in 1969 to address racial discrimination prevalent in both public and private life in many sovereign states. It was born out of the increasing independence of African colonies and increasing focus on decolonization. 

Becoming a part of CERD means to outlaw racial discriminations of all forms (hate speech, hate crimes, etc) and follow the terms of CERD.

CERD also establishes an international committee under the UN to oversee member states and their compliance.

Member states must also submit periodical reports and provide officials to answer and inquiries made by the committee.

# Who Does It Protect?
It protects all individuals and entities of member states from racial discrimination of any kind.

## Canada's Involvement

Canada signed CERD on August 24, 1966, committing itself to preventing racial discrimination of all types. Principles of CERD are found in various pieces of human rights related legislation including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, The Canadian Human Rights Act, and the Ontario Human Rights Act. 

However, this hasn't stopped lapses in racial discrimination and transgressions by the Canadian government, most notably against Indigenous communities.  The construction of various pipelines without the permission of surrounding Indigenous communities has been condemned and called for suspension by the committee overseeing CERD.
## Opposition

In 2018, Malaysia's far right party held a protest against the ratification of the CERD due to potential conflicts with Malaysia's constitution. Specifically, the special rights afforded to the Malay and Bumiputra racial groups. However, this protest took place after the government decided not to ratify the decision, turning it into a celebration rather than actual protest.

## Effectiveness?

While CERD is useful in reporting and making racial transgressions taking place in nation-states public as well as generating frameworks for countries to introduce anti-discrimination legislation, actual enforcement and elimination of racial discrimination proves to be a difficult task which CERD demonstrably lacks the capabilities to do so (examples being Canada's actions towards indigenous individuals and China's Uyghur reeducation camps which were both condemned under CERD yet still take place). Furthermore, even reporting has become spotty with ratifying countries like Sierra Leone not submitting reports since 1974 despite ratifying the convention in 1967.
