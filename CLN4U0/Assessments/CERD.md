# What is it?
The **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination** was adopted in 1965 and put into effect in 1969 to address racial discrimination prevalent in both public and private life in many sovereign states. It was born out of the increasing independence of African colonies and increasing focus on decolonization. 

Becoming a part of CERD means to outlaw racial discriminations of all forms (hate speech, hate crimes, etc) and follow the terms of CERD.

CERD also establishes an international committee under the UN to oversee member states and their compliance.

Member states must also submit periodical reports and provide officials to answer and inquiries made by the committee.

# Who Does It Protect?
It protects all individuals and entities of member states from racial discrimination of any kind.

## Opposition

In 2018, Malaysia's far right party held a protest against the ratification of the CERD due to potential conflicts with Malaysia's constitution. Specifically, the special rights afforded to the Malay and Bumiputra racial groups. However, this protest took place after the government decided not to ratify the decision, turning it into a celebration rather than actual protest.
