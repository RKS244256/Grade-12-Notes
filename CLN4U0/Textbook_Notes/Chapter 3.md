# Democracy
- A form of government in which the people possess and exercise power through a system of representation.
- Despite many nations implementing elections for officials and are therefore considered "democratic", it can be argued that representatives won't necessarily reflect the views and interests of their constituents. 
- Socialists may argue influence by the wealthy may skew and invalidate the "one person, one vote" principle of democracy. Capitalists may counter socialist societies ultimately restrict the rights of individuals.
- Democracy's principle of "one person, one vote" may lead to the majority weaponizing their votes against minorities.

# Sovereignty and Jurisdiction
- Sovereignty and Jurisdiction are two distinct yet related concepts.
## Sovereignty
- Sovereignty refers to the principle that nation-states (societies with defined border and laws) may impose whatever laws they deem fit within their boundaries.
- Sovereignty dates back to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia in which neighboring nation-states could impose laws and policies without the influences of each other.
- This principle stayed mostly intact until WWII when Germany exercised their freedom to institute policies which oppressed and killed millions of their own citizens.
- The UN was set up and in part, limited the sovereignty of member nation-states. 
- Nation-states part of the UN could now be subjected to intervention should they commit genocide, war crimes, or other international crimes.
- This limitation of sovereignty via international law has ideally, protected the individual rights of citizens of sovereign states.
## Jurisdiction
- Jurisdiction has multiple meanings.
- Generally refers to the boundaries and parameters in which an authority may operate.
- Sovereignty refers to national bounds whereas jurisdiction is more limited in scale.
- An example of jurisdiction is the levels of government within Canada. 
- Jurisdiction can also apply to geographical limits.
- An example is a school board having power within the physical boundaries and schools assigned to the board.

# Power and Authority

| Power                                                                                | Authority                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ability to act or refrain from acting                                                | The legal right to do something                                                   |
| The Canadian government has the power to enforce laws it enacts.                     | Because of the BNA act, the Canadian government has the legal right to make laws. |
| Power doesn't need to necessarily be granted legally. (Example is police brutality). |                                                                                   |
# Legitimacy and Ownership

### Legitimacy
- Legitimacy refers to the lawful right to inherit property or titles.
- Also refers to that which is lawful or recognized by law
- Examples include certain members of the royal bloodline who have a legitimate claim to the crown.
### Ownership
- Ownership refers to being the legitimate owner.
- This concept is contested by those with opposing ideologies such as Marxists and First Nation peoples.
- Many are highly critical of the methods employed by nation-states to obtain ownership of land which were often conquest and war.
- Due to the nuances and differing ideologies, the concept of ownership is still contested and debated to this day with some nations outlawing ownership altogether.

# Rights and Duties
- The abstract meaning of a right is what is correct or just.
- It commonly refers to the legal entitlement to particular properties, privileges, services, or possessions.
- In reality, a legal right is not invulnerable and requires an implicit duty from authority to protect it. If your right to free speech is infringed, you rely on the government to intervene on your behalf.

# Equality and Equity
| Equality                                                                                                                | Equity                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Treating everyone equally and in the same way                                                                           | Treating everyone in terms of fairness                                                                       |
| Treating people equally does not necessarily equate to treating people equitably.                                       | Equity treats based on cases and nuance.                                                                     |
| Broad treatment regardless of uneven circumstances.                                                                     |                                                                                                              |
| Could require a judge to enforce the rule of law without room for consideration of different circumstances or fairness. | Could permit a judge to be more lenient or harsh despite the strict rule of law in the interest of fairness. |
| Example: A fixed fine of $500 for speeding                                                                              | Example: A variable fine for speeding based on income level                                                  |

# Morality and Humanity
## Humanity
- Kindness towards humankind
- Example: Crimes against humanity are crimes which are so terrible, they are deserving of condemnation by all of humankind.
## Morality
- Morality is the considerations which determine whether an action is right or wrong.
- Often personal in nature.
- Could be influenced by societal, religious, or cultural factors.
- Laws are concerned with representing the morality of the community as a whole rather than the morality of the individual.
- Law nevertheless often acts as an arbiter or judge of morality and can impose moral standards not reflective of the majority/community.

# Law and Justice
- Law has always been associated with justice as justice is the ultimate goal law aims to achieve.

| Law                                           | Justice                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creates societal order                        | Creates fairness and equity                                                            |
| Rule of law is the backbone and primary value | Civil disobedience is permissible if laws are unjust                                   |
| Allows for disputes to be solved fairly       | A judge is warranted in deviating from the law in an unusual case by setting precedent |
| Defends persons, property, and rights         | A law must reflect moral law to be just                                                |

## Justice
- Justice is a much more abstract concept than law in which law (somewhat paradoxically imo) sets the standard for justice. 
- Ideally, what the law is is just. However, legal philosophers have discussed the idea of justice for millennia. 
- Most agree justice should be linked with equality of treatment. (A child shouldn't incur the same penalty as an adult)
- This leads to justice requiring a balance of equity and equality to uphold respect for all peoples.
- This balance shifts depending on era. Many societies would have considered preferential treatment of a wealthy landlord to a slave to be just whereas it would not in modern Canada.
- Justice is focused primarily on how law is applied rather than the statutes and laws themselves. (People may follow a law if it's applied equally even if they disagree with the law in principle)
- It's important to note this not only applied to penalties but to benefits and often requires the circumstances which enjoy preferential or harsher treatment are pertinent to the issue at hand.
- Justice applies to both substantive and procedural law 
- The application of justice deals with distributive justice (a fair distribution of honors and rewards by the state according to worth or merit.)
- This plays into how we should general reward good and penalize bad.
- This creates a complex and nuanced tension in which justice must apply distributive justice with fairness and equity in a way that also adheres to the rule of law.
