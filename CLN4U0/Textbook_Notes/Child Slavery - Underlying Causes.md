The use of child soldiers is one of the most frowned upon acts in the international community. Various organizations have denounced and have worked to combat the use of child soldiers in armed conflicts through programs, conventions, and activist movements.

However, these actions are almost always ignored by perpetrators of this act.

There are 3 critical factors which perpetuate the use of child soldiers:
1. Social disruptions as a result of globalization, war and disease
2. Technological improvements enabling easier use of weapons for children
3. A rise in more brutal and criminalized type of conflict in which the meta is to employ low-cost child soldiers to generate a considerable force.

# Societal Factors

Globalization, while beneficial for developed countries, does not create an equitable or homogeneous world economy, enabling a considerable magnitude of global human insecurity.

> Global human insecurity can be defined as deficiencies in security, income, literacy, housing, and other basic human needs and QoL measures

Many of the ramifications of such socioeconomic failings fall to youth which in turn, become part of the labor pool for illegal economies and activities.

As natural resources deplete and world population increases, failures in QoL and social stability will be exacerbated and create a negative feedback loop.

Conflict groups are aware of the gaps in security and QoL of their community's youth and will exploit it by undermining remaining stability and/or filling the gaps themselves, building trust and reliance of such groups.

Aside from war, famine and outbreaks also create a similar situation in which demographics can shift in which the population middle-aged may be diminished, adding to further instability and security as younger men (known for more aggressive tendencies) will engage in *coalitional aggression*. Conflict groups can take advantage of this demographic shift to recruit more young men as they do not have the guiding and tempered influences of the older generation.

As these factors work through communities, prolonged war may lead to children who have never seen peace and are therefore more prone to recruitment and manipulation. Children may find solace in these conflict groups as they provide protection and order in an otherwise chaotic environment irrespective of actual content or actions of said group.

>TL;DR Many of the world's child soldiers are taken from the poorest, least educated, and most marginalized communities which have been plagued by either famine, war, or disease or some combination of these factors. The low QoL as well as large demographic shifts contribute to the phenomenon in which young men and children are easily recruited by conflict groups, either willingly or by force.


# Weapons and Technological Advancements

The technological advancements of war have broadened the demographics capable of participating in war. 

> Light arms include assault rifles, RPGs, etc.

Typically, the cheapest of weaponry tend to benefit the most from this phenomenon. With manufacturing of light arms incorporating advancements like plastic making weapons lighter, it lowers the barrier of entry into war, allowing children to participate with arms which would have otherwise been too heavy.

Furthermore, the ease of use, lack of need of maintenance and simplicity of weapons such as AK-47s and their derivatives and clones have allowed children to learn how to function one in around 30 minutes.

The proliferation of cheap and easy access to light arms is partially a result of the Cold War as surpluses of weapons found their way into the illicit war economy at pennies on the dollar. 

Such commonality of arms erodes civility and makes it so any conflict can easily turn violent. As a result, the power structures in a community can often shift so youth are placed above their elders and age groupings become obsolete through the threat of violence via newfound access to arms which can further enable poor management of conflict. 

>TL;DR the easy access to cheap and light weaponry enables conflict and particularly, children to easily take part in conflict. Weapons allow for the easy development of armies of young yet deadly children and prove to be a detriment to the recovery and restabilization of nations post-conflict.

# Post Modern Warfare

In modern day conflicts in developing countries, the idea of a *warrior's honor* (or more simply the reasons to continue war) have eroded, replaced with warfare which is often deemed criminal and messy. Profit has become the primary motivation of war in contrast to the usually ideological motives of the last era of warfare.

Warfare now often involves the capture and seizure of valuable resources and/or activities with the sole purpose of generating profit in the area with the leading risk factor of infighting within a nation being economical motivations for conflict.

Despite the relatively newfound economical motives of many conflicts, the degree of violence found has not decreased. Rather, the focus has shifted to profit rather than winning the hearts and minds of the community in favor of your preferred ideology.

# Child Labor

The socioeconomic state of many countries has created a large supply of potential and effective child soldiers. The use of child soldiers is appealing because of their low cost (many are not paid) and easy assimilation into army ranks. The only potential downside is moral opposition which is usually disregarded.

> TL;DR Child soldiers are a low-investment method of generating a considerable army granted you don't care about the populations you source from.

Many warlords and conflict profiteers emerge from failed nation states with a willingness to break old norms and mobilize forces in their interests. An easy way to do so is to use child soldiers. 

As a result of these realizations, children part of these conflicts are often no longer afforded their rights and are rather treated as malleable and expendable assets.
