## Secondary Sources

### Definition
Secondary sources are laws and cases codified in response to primary sources.
### Constitutions
- Constitutions are the fundamental frameworks which dictate the operation of government.
- In the case of the Canadian Constitution, it is the highest level of law in Canada which takes precedence over all other legislation.
- The Constitution allows for government of all levels to legislate and pass laws.
- It determines the jurisdictions of each level of government.
- If a law is outside a level of government's jurisdiction, it's considered **ultra vires*** (outside its power)
- Inversely, if a law is within a level of government's jurisdiction, it's considered **intra vires***

### Statute Law
- A statute is a law passed by elected officials at the federal or provincial level.
- A statute can vary in complexity, scope, and length
- Some statutes require supplemental legal documents for further detail. These documents are referred to as orders-in-council or regulations though their authority matches that of a statute.
- Proposed legislation is first introduced to the federal or provincial legislature in the form of a draft bill.
- For a bill to be passed, the bill undergoes examination by a legislative committee in addition to 3 readings within the House of Commons before requiring a majority vote from both Parliament and the Senate. The Lieutenant Governor signs the bill, granting royal ascent and allows it to become law, now called a statute or act.
- Federal and provincial governments are given the power to enact statutes via the BNA act within our constitution.

### Judicial Decisions
- The law in Canada is based on a dual system in which not only are statutes and codes considered but the recorded judicial rulings of previous cases.
- The use of previous cases to determine law is called **common law**
- Common law in England began when **King Henry the II** directed judges to record their decisions to have them reviewed and discussed with other judges. The most well reasoned verdicts would be widely distributed and became "common" laws now known today as **case law**.
- An example of case law is **tort law** (law concerning negligence) as it's almost entirely based on case law.
- With the introduction of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, law needs to be evaluated using both case law and the consideration of the Charter.
- Case law and its use involves extracting legal principles from previous rulings and applying them to current situations as prior judgements are to be followed. This principal is called **stare decisis** (an abbreviation of the phrase *stare decisis et non quieta movere*) aka **rule of precedent**.
- The rule of precedent dictates cases should be decided exactly like a prior ruling if the material or key facts are the same. Such a system ensures predictability and uniformity.
- Although in theory, the rule of precedent is effective, in practice, majority of cases vary in circumstance and therefore, prior rulings would not effectively provide a proper ruling.
- Despite this, there is a general rule which explains the reasoning for a verdict could apply to at least a few other cases. This rule is called **ratio decidendi** or reason for deciding.
- Lawyers will use ratio decidendi to identify parallels and intersections within prior cases which aid their cases.
- Ratio decidendi permits a level of flexibility whilst preserving the predictability and uniformity.
- If there is no previous precedent, judges rely on their own sense of fairness and justice to create new precedent.
- Precedent can also be overturned by higher courts than the court which created it or by new statues as both bind lower courts.
- The only court not bound by precedent is the Supreme Court of Canada
- .Statute law always overrides case law.

# Historical Perspectives and Development

Summaries will be presented like this
```
## Code of Hammurabi

Hammurabi was a king in Babylon who had a code of laws engraved in columns which were displayed publicly at the town square. This code is one of the earliest surviving legal codes and provides insight into the beliefs and social structures of ancient Babylon. For example, punishments were determined by social status and was often severe, following an "eye for an eye" rhetoric.

`It becomes obvious the application of the law was not applied fairly as those considered enslaved would often face harsher judgements and punishments than their free counterparts`

```
Hammurabi was a Babylonian king who codified an early example of a legal code. Punishments were determined by offence and social standing.
```


## Mosaic Law

Ancient laws of Athens were written on large marble slabs and displaced in a similar manner to those in Babylon. 

`The public display of these laws often to ensure equal access to the law for the general public and to ensure impartial application`

Around 400BCE, Athenians introduced the idea of juries and established rule of law

`Athenian law was more progressive, fair, and equally applied in contrast to Babylonian law.`

```
Athenian law took strides in issues such as rule of law and juries. These are topics which serve as a fundamental basis for many modern legal codes.
```

## Roman Law

Roman laws were engraved on bronze plaques called the *Twelve Tables* which have since been lost. It's thought that these plaques were commissioned by the lower class to address the arbitrary rulings and laws which afforded too much power to the upper classes.

`A common purpose we see between the inscription all 3 early legal codes is it provides universal access to law at the very least and can further combat uneven application of the law.`

```
Roman law was engraved into bronze by the lower class to prevent the uneven and often arbitrary application of the law which primarily benefitted the upper class.
```

## French Civil Law

```
The Civil Law System originates from France and is only employed in Quebec for on-criminal and non-constitutional cases.
The Civil Law System refers to the legal system in which all laws are codified as statutes as well as the inquisitorial system during trials which allows the judge to assume a more active role within the courtroom. 
```

Civil law within this context refers to law which is codified in statutes (the civil law system is a system in which all laws are codified). The civil law system is based on the **French Civil Code** which was introduced by Napoleon Benapart in 1804. In the civil law system, an inquisitorial approach is used rather than an adversarial approach in trials. This permits the judge to ask questions and take a more active role in relation to the adversarial system. 

`What would be the advantages and disadvantages of both systems?` 
`The main differences are the strict codified nature of civil law as well as the inquisitive approach in trials.`

Quebec is the only province which uses the civil law system in Canada under the Quebec Act of 1774 in which they are allowed to use civil law for non-criminal and non-constitucontrollertional cases.

## British Common Law

```
Common law is what most of Canada's law is based/influenced by. It refers to adopted British law, law which applies to all, and case law.
```

The most significant influence to Canadian law is British law. The British common law system was created by William of Normandy to centralize British laws and create a system which applied to all of Britain.

`Before this point, counties would follow their own laws.`

Gradually, common law developed and standardized law within England. The current English system of law was created by King Henry II in which King Henry appointed travelling judges aka circuit judges to visit villages and hear cases. Judges would then gather with each other and discuss cases. These verdicts were then written down at some point, forming common law.

`This is also where precedent and case law also comes into play`

Common law has 3 meanings:
1. Law which comes from Britain
2. Law which applies to all
3. Case law

#### Methods of Adjudication

##### Trial by Ordeal
- Determines guilt via subjecting the accused to an "ordeal". 
- This often involved maiming the accused and using the outcome to determine guilt (example being if an inflicted wound was infected or healed after a certain period of time).
- It was possible to dispute a verdict of guilt through "oath-helpers" who would swear an oath of innocence of the accused.
- Eventually phased out as religious devoutness declined and backlash emerged,

##### Trial by Combat (Judicial Duel)
- Innocence is determined by the outcome of a duel between the accuser and accused.
- A supposed forerunner of the adversarial system.
- Eventually phased out as religious devoutness declined and backlash emerged.

##### Early Court Systems
- Necessary when judging the accused for an offence against society/the state.
- The modern court system spawned out of the communal court, manorial tribunals, and royal court system.
- The communal court was created within small communities and run by locals.
- Manorial tribunals were common during the period of which the feudal system was in place within England
- The royal court was initially created to collect taxes through the court of Exchequer.
- Another court, the Court of Chancery where commands and summons to court were dispatched and obtained.
- The Court of Common Pleas handled civil matters (between individuals).
- The Court of King's Bench dealt with serious criminal cases and was composed of various appointed nobles. The modern equivalent is the Court of King's Bench
- Judicial authority came from the Crown by the 13th century.
- Judicial authority still lies with the Crown in Common-wealth countries (Hence why criminal cases are Rex/Regina v \_\_\_\_\_).
- Much of our modern court systems stem from these courts and often are modern day equivalents.

##### Origins Of The Jury
- The modern day jury system also comes from British influence.
- Juries were initially made up of local landlords who primarily dealt with land disputes.
- Juries comes from the Latin word *jurati* which means "to be sworn".
- By 1219, juries began hearing criminal cases too.
- Initially, they served as witnesses in these cases.
- By the 15th century, jurors became triers of fact and have now become an independent check on the government as they were optimistically free of bias, fear of punishment, and incentive from authority figures and could decide based on facts and evidence.
