## Vertebrate Nervous System

The vertebrate nervous system is made up of the **Central Nervous System** & **Peripheral Nervous System**.

![[Nervous System - Nervous System Overview.canvas]]
### Central Nervous System

Made up of the *brain* & *spinal cord* (specifically the nerves). Center of integration & control.

Highly protected with bone.
- Skull protects brain
- Spine/Vertebrae protects spinal cord
#### Meninges

The brain is also protected with the **meninges**. *Meninges* refers to 3 layers of membrane:
1. Dura Mater
2. Arachnoid Mater
3. Pia Mater

It provides structural support whilst also containing **cerebrospinal fluid** (which cushions, nourishes, & protects the brain & spinal cord from toxins)
##### Dura Mater
Outermost layer. Adheres to the skull & *Arachnoid Mater*. Provides brain & spinal cord with an additional layer of protection, attaches the brain to the skull, & attaches spinal cord to **vertebral column** to prevent jostling. Also provides a system of **veinous drainage** to allow blood to leave the brain.

There is a gap between the spinal cord *dura mater* and the *vertebral column* known as the **epidural space**. This is where analgesics and anesthesia such as epidural are administered.
##### Arachnoid Mater
Consistency of a cobweb. Attached to *Pia Mater* via connective tissue called **Arachnoid Trabeculae** which helps suspend the brain in place. The empty space (**Subarchnoid Space**) is filled with *cerebrospinal fluid*. 
##### Pia Mater
Thin layer which lines the contours of the brain. Acts as an additional barrier & aids in the secretion and containment of *cerebrospinal fluid*.

#### Brain
The major centre of the nervous system which receives, integrates, stores, and retrieves information. 
##### Regions
- **Medulla Oblongata**: Connects the *spinal cord* to the *cerebellum*. Essential for autonomic nervous control.
- **Cerebellum**: Involved in muscle movement & balance.
- **Pons**: Transfers signals between the *cerebellum* and *medulla oblongata*
- **Cerebrum**: Involved in motor activities and sensory information. Largest region of the brain and can be subdivided into lobes based on function.

#### Spinal Cord

The incoming neurons (aka *sensory/afferent neurons*) from the *peripheral nervous system* enter an area of the spinal cord called the **dorsal root** which then connect to the *interneurons* which then send information up the spinal cord & into the *brain*.

The *brain* will then respond by sending a response message back down to the *interneurons* in the spinal cord which then passes it through the **ventral root** to the *motor neurons*. The *efferent/motor neurons* will then send the message to effectors such as organs or muscles.
### Peripheral Nervous System

Nerves between the organs and *Central Nervous System*. Subdivided into the **somatic** & **autonomic** nerves.

## Peripheral Nervous System

Made up of *afferent & efferent neurons*. The *afferent neurons* send messages to the *central nervous system* and the *CNS* coordinates a message to send to *efferent neurons* which will send it to *effectors* to execute.

It's divided into the **Somatic & Autonomic nervous systems**

### Somatic Nervous System

The conscious and voluntary section of the *PNS*. Carries signals to the **skeletal muscles** and contains 31 pairs of spinal nerves which serve different parts of the body.

### Autonomic Nervous System

The unconscious and involuntary section of the *PNS*. Takes information to the target cell. Carries signals to glands in the *endocrine system* & **smooth muscle**.

Is further subdivided into the **Sympathetic & Parasympathetic divisions**.

#### Sympathetic Division

Involved in situations of high stress, activity, excitement. 

Controls *fight or flight* response.

Functions not important to *flight or flight* slow.

#### Parasympathetic Division

Involved in rest state & low stress situations.

Returns functions to normal rate.
## Nervous Tissue

### Neurons

The functional units of the *nervous system*. Includes **sensory neurons**, **interneurons**, **motor neurons**.

#### Types of Neurons
##### Sensory Neurons

Also known as **afferent** neurons. Sense & relay info (stimuli) from the environment to the *CNS*. Also, from internal organs to the *CNS*. Located in clusters found outside the spinal cord.

##### Interneurons

Also known as **association** neurons. Predominately in *brain* & *spinal cord*. Integrate & interpret sensory stimuli & connect incoming *afferent neurons* to outgoing **efferent neurons**.

##### Motor Neurons

Also known as *efferent neurons*. Relay information to **effectors** (muscles, organs, glands).

### Gilial Cells

Non-conducting cells. Involved with structural support & metabolism of neurons.

### Dendrites

Projections of cells body. Receives and carries impulses toward cell body.

### Axon (aka Nerve Fiber)

Extension of cytoplasm. Sends impulses away from the cell body toward neurons and/or effectors.
- Axon terminals either connect to another dendrite or to a muscle/gland (effector)

### Myelin Sheath

Made of fatty protein. Surrounds & insulates axon. Formed by Schwann cells (Glial cells). Speeds up signal transmission. Not all axons are myelinated. 

### Nodes of Ranvier

Spaces between segments of myelin sheath. Nerve impulses "jump" from node to node to speed up rate of transmission.

## Neural Pathway

General pathway of a signal from stimulus to reaction.

Sensory receptors -> Afferent Neurons -> Interneurons -> Efferent neurons -> Effector
