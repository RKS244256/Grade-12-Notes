The **renal system** (*urinary system*) is an **excetory system** for **urine**. 

The *renal system*:
1. Extracts waste from the bloodstream
2. Converts it into urine
3. Transports and eliminates it

It consists of:
- 2 Kidneys
- 2 Ureters
- 1 Bladder
- 1 Urethra

## Nephrons

**Nephrons** are the structural & functional units of the *kidney*. Each kidney contains **over 1 million nephrons**

Each nephron contains a **Bowman's capsule** and a **glomerulus**

*Nephrons* are responsible for removing the various molecules from blood such as *urea* & *excess sodium ions*. They are also responsible in maintaining fluid balances by permitting the reabsorption of water.

### Blood Vessels in the Nephron

Blood travels into *nephrons* via the **afferent arterioles** and exits the *nephrons* via the **efferent arterioles**

*Afferent arterioles* branch off the *renal artery* & supply nephrons with blood. They branch into a **capillary bed** known as the **glomerulus**. 

The blood is then filtered where the *glomerulus* meets the *nephron*.

Blood will then leave the *glomerulus* via *efferent arterioles* to a **capillary bed** wrapped around the *nephron*.

### Bowman's Capsule

The *glomerulus* is surrounded by a cup-shaped tissue called the **Bowman's capsule**.

The *Bowman's capsule* along with the afferent & efferent arterioles are located in the *renal cortex*.

Waste from the blood will enter the *Bowman's capsule* from the blood flowing through the *glomerulus* which is filtered into the *Bowman's capsule* due to high pressure created in the *glomerulus*.

The *Bowman's capsule* then tapers into the **proximal tubule** which then carries the **filtrate (waste)** into the **loop of Henle** which then connects to the **distal tubule** which connects to the **collecting ducts** which then merges the waste with collected from nephrons before merge into the **renal pelvis** before exiting the *kidneys* via the *ureters*. (More on urine production in another note.)

## Kidneys

- Bean shaped organs located at the back of the **abdominal cavity**
- It has 3 regions
1. Renal Cortex
2. Medulla
3. Renal Pelvis
![](Kidney.png)

- Blood travels from the **aorta** to the *kidney* via the **renal artery**
- Blood travels from the *kidney* in the **vena cava** via the **renal vein**

## Ureters

Narrow, muscular tubes roughly **11 inches in length** & **3/8 inch in diameter** attached to the *kidneys*.

Each *kidney* has 1 ureter attached which carries urine to the **urinary bladder**
## Bladder

The **bladder** is a muscular, membranous sac that acts as a reservoir for urine.

The *ureters* enter the bladder and transport urine. As urine enters the *bladder*, its muscular walls expand.

A **urinary sphincter** is found at the base of the *bladder* which when relaxed, will expel and void the urine into the **urethra**. 

The average adult will need to *void* their bladder when it is filled with **300mL** of urine & an average of **1000mL** is voided daily.

## Urethra

The **urethra** extends from the *bladder* to the outside of the body.

It is **7.8 inches long** & transports **urine** & **semen** in males.

It is **1.2 inches long** & transports urine in females.

## Urinalysis

A laboratory procedure ilving the examination of a urine sample. Urine will undergo chemical changes when standing so *urinalysis* is performed within an hour of voiding. This procedure is a valuable diagnostic tool in medical applications.

## Catheterization

The insertion of a plastic tube through the *urethra* & into the bladder to completely drain the bladder of urine.
