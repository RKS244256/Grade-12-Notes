A **synapse** is the point of communication between *two neurons* or between a *neuron* and an *effector*.

Synapses describes what happens after *Action Potential* and how a signal can jump between neurons.

**Synaptic vesicles** containing **Neurotransmitters** are found in the end plates of *terminal axons*.

## Types of Transmission

There are 2 types of Synapse Transmission:

### Excitatory Synaptic Transmission

![[Excitatory_Synapse_Diagram.jpeg]]

Action Potential arrives at the presynaptic neuron's axon which:

1. Causes the **voltage gated calcium channels to open**
2. Calcium 2+ ions diffuse into the cell
3. Ca 2+ causes **synaptic vesicles** to release their *neurotransmitters* into the **synaptic cleft** via **Exocytosis**
4. The neurotransmitters cross the *synaptic cleft* via diffusion
5. Neurotransmitters bind to the *Na+ gated channels* on the **Postsynaptic membrane**
6. *Na+ gated channels* open
7. *Na+ floods in*
8. Cell depolarizes
9. Action potential is fired & the signal is passed to the postsynaptic neuron

The reason this process is excitatory is because binding the NT to the postsynaptic causes Na+ to diffuse into the neuron and trigger depolarization. This means less stimulus is required to trigger Action Potential.

### Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission

Instead of the neurotransmitter binding to *Na+ gated channels*, it binds to ***K+ gated channels*** which allows K+ ions to flow **out** of the cell, hyperpolarizing the cell & raising the required stimulus required to trigger Action Potential. Nerve impulses therefore cannot continue.

## Neurotransmitters

### Acetylcholine

**Acetylcholine** is notable as a case study as it's an excitatory neurotransmitter which causes depolarization. The issue is after the impulse has been carried, the presence of Acetylcholine keeps the gates open. An enzyme called **Acetylcholinesterase** will break down Acetylcholine and eject it from the cell to be reformed and reused.

### Other Neurotransmitters

Other NTs may be removed from the synapse different. For examples, they can be removed using proteins that will take the NT back to the presynaptic neuron for reuse.

Other NTs include:
- Serotonin
- Dopamine
- GABA
- Glutamic Acid
- Norepinepherine

## Summation

The effect produced by the accumulation of Neurotransmitters from two or more neurons.
