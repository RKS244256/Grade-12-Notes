When we experience pain, *sensory/afferent neurons* respond to chemicals released by the damaged cells & carry a signal to a cell in the spinal cord called the **Substantia Gelatinosa cells**.

These cells produce a *neurotransmitter* which transmits a message to the *brain* via the **ascending pathway** which interprets the message as pain.

More granularly, a neuron called the **first order neuron** synapses (releases a *neurotransmitter*) and relays the pain to a **second order neuron** which crosses from the dorsal side of the spine to the **Spinothalamic Tract**. 

The *second order neuron* will then carry it up the ascending pathway to the brain via the *Spinothalamic Tract* and end at the **thalamus** in the brain. 

The *thalamus* then fires a **third order neuron** which sends the signal to the part of the brain which correlates with the injured tissue. This is where our perception of pain manifests (location, intensity, etc).

Our brain responds by releasing natural painkillers called **endorphins** & **enkephalins** (opioid). These painkillers attach to the *Substantia Gelatinosa cells* and prevent the communication from the injured tissues.

More granularly, neurons in the **descending pathway** will inhibit the communication between the *first & second order neurons* of the ascending pathway in order to control and stop pain signals from reaching the brain. 

This can be done by releasing neurotransmitters such as *noradrenaline* or **serotonin** which will bind to the *presynaptic neuron* & inhibit the release of its *neurotransmitter* and will also stimulate an *interneuron* which will release opioids such as *endorphins* & *enkephalins*.

These opioids will further inhibit the *presynaptic neuron*'s release of its *neurotransmitter* and will also prevent the *postsynaptic neuron* from depolarizing, rendering unable to reach *action potential*.
