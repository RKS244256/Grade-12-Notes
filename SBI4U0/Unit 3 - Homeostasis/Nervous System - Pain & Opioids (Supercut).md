When we experience pain, *sensory/afferent neurons* respond to chemicals released by the damaged cells & carry a signal to a cell in the spinal cord called the **Substantia Gelatinosa cells**.

These cells produce a *neurotransmitter* which transmits a message to the *brain* via the **ascending pathway** which interprets the message as pain.

Our brain responds by releasing natural painkillers called **endorphins** & **enkephalins** (opioid) via the **descending pathway**. These painkillers attach to the *Substantia Gelatinosa cells* and prevent the communication from the injured tissues.
