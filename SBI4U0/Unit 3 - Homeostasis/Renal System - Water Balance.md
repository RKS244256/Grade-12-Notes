The body adjusts to
- **Increased water intake** by **increasing urine output**
- **Decreased water intake** (or exercise) by **decreasing urine output**

This is to maintain homeostasis and the *nervous system* and *endocrine system* have to communicate.

Water balance is regulated by the hormone **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone)** which regulates osmotic pressure by causing the *kidneys* to increase water absorption.

## ADH

**ADH** is produced in the *hypothalamus* & stored & released by the *posterior pituitary gland*. 

It increases the permeability of the **distal tubule** & **collecting duct** to water to allow the body to reabsorb more water. However, this causes the volume of *urine* to decrease & its concentration to increase, leading to a more yellow color and stronger smell.

**85%** of water filtered into the nephron is reabsorbed in the *proximal convoluted tubule* which is already very permeable to water.

*ADH* allows the *distal convoluted tubule* and *collecting duct* to also become permeable to water, allowing increased water reabsorption. 

Without **ADH**, none of the **15%** is reabsorbed.

## Trigger & Response

As the body's water decreased, the \[blood solutes] increase leading to an increase in the blood's **osmotic pressure**. In order to correct this, there are two responses.

**Osmoreceptors** in **hypothalamic cells** detect changes in the osmotic pressure which causes water from the *hypothalamic cells* to move into the bloodstream via **osmosis**, causing the *hypothalamic cells* to shrink.

The shrinkage of *hypothalamic cells* causes a nerve message to be sent to the **posterior pituitary gland** to release **ADH**. Shrinking of the *hypothalamic cells* also causes the sensation of **thirst**. 



Both lower the **blood osmotic pressure** which causes the blood to become more dilute and water to move from the blood into the *hypothalamus*. 

Hypothalamic cells swell due to the water intake and stop sending nerve messages to the *posterior pituitary gland*, stopping the release of **ADH** & **thirst**. The water balance has been restored.

### ADH

**ADH** travels to the kidneys via blood which causes the kidneys & nephrons to reabsorb more water in order to restore balance and lower the **blood osmotic pressure**.

### Thirst

This prompts a person to increase their water intake which also lowers the **blood osmotic pressure**.

## Diuretics

Diuretics are drugs which inhibit the release of **ADH** leading to an increased frequency & volume of urine. If taken excessively, it can lead to dehydration.

Examples include:
- Alcohol
- Caffeine
