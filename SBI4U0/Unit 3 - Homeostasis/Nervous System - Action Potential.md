The basis for **action potentials** & the reason they work are **concentration gradients**. 

`FYI, the concentration gradient is the difference in ion concentration between the inside & outside of the neuron (extracellular fluid) in this context.`

## Types of Ion Channels

**Leak channels** are open all the time

**Gated channels**

Open and closed under certain conditions. The most important in this context is the **Voltage Gated Channels** which require a certain voltage difference across the membrane to open/close. All *voltage gated channels* are closed during *resting potential*.
## States

There are two main states. **Resting & Action Potential**.

### Resting Potential

Neurons have a negative concentration gradient called *resting potential*. This is the default as nothing is happening. There is no impulse.

Typically, *resting potential* is **-70mV**

#### Conditions for Resting Potential

1. There are more **Na+** ions outside of the cell than inside the neuron
2. There are more **K+** ions inside the cell than outside the neuron
3. Large, negatively charged proteins inside the neuron.
4. Negatively charged on the inside, positively charged on the outside
5. Cell is considered **Polarized** due to unequal distribution of positively charged ions inside and outside of the cell.

#### Maintenance

The gradient has **Na+, K+ leak channels** & a **Na+/K+ pump**.

**Leak channels** will diffuse ions out of the cell with the gradient (*Passive Transport*).

As such, the *K+ leak channel* will diffuse outside the cell with the gradient whereas the *Na+ leak channel will diffuse but at a much slower rate relative to K+ due to only being partially permeable*. 

In order to keep a stable, negative resting potential in the membrane, it'll utilize a **Sodium-Potassium pump** to move *Na+/K+ ions* across the membrane via *Active Transport*. Therefore, there is no net movement of K+ & minimal movement of Na+ in the first place.

**The Sodium-Potassium pump** transports **3 Na+ ions out of the cell & 2 K+ ions into the cell***.

### Action Potential

Action potential occurs when the nerve becomes excited and there is a rapid reversal in the potential (mV) of the membrane. The movement of the action potential through an axon conducts the neural impulse.

#### Conditions for Action Potential

1. Reaches **+40 mV**
2. Stimulus reaches threshold.

### Threshold

A potential in which a stimulus must achieve in order to reach *action potential*.

`For example: A stimulus might need to reach -55mV in intensity in order to trigger action potential.`

Our neurons can either fire at full power or not at all so increasing the intensity of the stimulus beyond the threshold will not yield an increased response. The intensity of the impulse as well as its transmission speeds are constant.

Instead, a high intensity stimulus will yield a greater ***frequency of impulses*** allowing us to differentiate between intensities such as warm and hot.

## Stages

![[Action_Potential_Graph.png]]

When a stimulus sends an impulse, 3 stages are triggered in the action potential and neuron firing.

### Depolarization

The nerve impulse disturbs the plasma membrane on a dendrite which:

1. Causes the *Na+ gated channels* to open.
2. *Na+ ions* diffuse into the neuron with the electrochemical diffusion gradient

If the threshold is reached (Na+ ions can flow through because enough gates have opened and therefore increase the positive charge in the cell), 

3. more *voltage gated Na+ channels open*.

**^ This step must be achieved for the process to continue, otherwise it is a failed initiation** 

4. Na+ ions rush into the cell, rapidly increasing the charge of the cell and making it positive (**depolarization**). This achieves ***Action Potential***.

### Repolarization

At a specific voltage (**approximately +40mV aka Action Potential**),

5. The *Na+ gated channels* close
6. The *K+ gated channels* open
7. K+ ions rapidly flow out of the cell

These steps repolarize the cell and the cell is back to being negative on the inside and positive on the outside.

### Refractory Period

Despite a negative membrane potential, the ions are on the **wrong side**. Furthermore, this rapid ejection of *K+* ions may have **hyperpolarized** the cell, making it overly negative.

The *Sodium-Potassium pump* restores the cell to resting potential by ejecting **3 Na+ ions** & bringing in **2 K+ ions**, bringing balance to the cell. This process requires **ATP** as it's a form of *active transport*.

## Movement of Action Potential down a neuron (Dendrite to Axon)

For an impulse to be conducted along the **axon**, it must move (duh).

*Action potential* is officially when sodium channels open and depolarization occurs.

The *Na+ ions aka Action Potential* that rush in are attracted to the negative ions on the inside of the cell membrane which causes a chain reaction of sodium channels of the adjacent cell opening as it goes along the axon.
