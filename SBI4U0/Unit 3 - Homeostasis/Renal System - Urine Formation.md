**Urine Formation** occurs in 3 stages.
1. [Filtration](#Filtration)
2. [Reabsorption](#Reabsorption)
3. [Secretion](#Secretion)

## Filtration

**Filtration** is the movement of fluids from the blood into the *Bowman's capsule*.

Blood will move from the **Aorta** (circulatory system) -> **Renal Artery** (kidney) -> **Afferent Arteriole** (kidney) -> **Glomerulus** (nephron).

The *glomerulus* has a highly pressurized *capillary bed* in which **dissolved solutes** can move from areas of high pressure into areas of low pressure via a **selectively permeable membrane**. 

This means the solutes can pass through the walls of the *glomerulus* into *Bowman's capsule*.

**Not all materials in blood can enter the Bowman's capsule. Only small molecules**

**Can enter:**
- Water
- Ions
- Small Amino Acids (**AA**)

**Cannot enter:**
- Red Blood Cells (RBC)
- White Blood Cells (WBC)
- Proteins
- Large molecules in general

## Reabsorption

**120mL** of fluids and substances are filtered out of the blood into the **nephron tubules** via the *glomerulus* in the **filtration stage**.

We **cannot** lose this amount of water and maintain *homeostasis*. **119mL** is reabsorbed out of the nephron and into the *capillaries wrapped around the nephron* into the bloodstream. 

Depending on the substance, reabsorption may be **active** or **passive**.

Reabsorption happens until the **threshold level** of a substance is reached.

### Water Reabsorption

The **solutes** transported out of the nephron and into **interstitial fluid** created an **osmotic gradient** along the **descending loop of Henle**. This will draw water out into the *interstitial fluid* via *osmosis*.

A second osmotic force is created by the *proteins in the blood in the capillaries*. Proteins in the blood draw water from the interstitial fluid back into the blood for redistribution.

## Secretion

Secretion is the process in which waste moves into the distal and collecting tubules from the blood. Substances move via **active transport**. As such, the cells which line the *distal tubule* are high in *mitochondria*.

Nitrogen containing waste such as *urea* & *uric acid* along with excess H<sup>+</sup> & K<sup>+</sup> are secreted.

The filtrate is now called **Urine**.
