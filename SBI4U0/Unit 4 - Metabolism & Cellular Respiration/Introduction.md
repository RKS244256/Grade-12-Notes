Metabolism is the collective name for all chemical rxns which occur in the body. It's the sum of all **anabolic** & **catabolic** processes in a cell/organism.

In order to live, organisms require the capture, storage, and use of energy.

`Energy is the capacity to do work`

# Energy
## Laws of Thermodynamics

Energy can **neither be created nor destroyed**. However, it can be **transformed** from one form to another. (**First Law of Thermodynamics**)

Energy cannot be transformed from one form to another without the loss of **useful energy** (**Second Law of Thermodynamics**)

`Useful energy (aka free energy) is energy available to do work. Energy lost is no longer free energy as it is not available to do work.`

Transformations of energy occur within cells many times and as such, requires a constant supply of energy.

## Activation Energy

Activation energy is the amount of energy required for reactants to enter the **Transition State**.

`The Transition State is a temporary condition which involves the bonds of reactions breaking and bonds between products forming.`

## Exo/Endo Rxns

### Exothermic Reactions

Reactions which release more energy than what is absorbed in the rxn. Examples include *cellular respiration*.

### Endothermic Reactions

More energy is absorbed and stored in the products than released in the reaction. Examples include *photosynthesis*.

## Redox Reactions

**Redox rxns** are reactions which involve the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.

**Oxidation** is the process of losing electrons

**Reduction** is the process of losing electrons

`LEO says GER -> Lose Electrons = Oxidation, Gain Electrons = Reduction`

**Coupled reactions** occur in which the product of one redox reaction is the reaction in the next which forms a series. Free energy is released in each step of this process which could drive another reaction.

# ATP Cycle

`Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphroyl group (PO3) to a molecule`

When ATP is broken down, energy stored within the triphosphate bond is released. This energy is **not** in the form of *thermal energy* as this could be dangerous to the cell. 

Instead, this reaction is coupled with an *endothermic reaction* in which the phosphate (and the energy it carries) is bonded with another molecule associated with the work the cell was going to do anyways. This is called phosphorylation.

High energy bonds in ATP do not require a high energy.

Cells do not store a surplus of ATP. Instead, they will consume and produce it as needed.
## Uses for ATP

There are **3** particular uses:

-**Chemical Work** 
Synthesizing macromolecules

-**Mechanical Work**
Muscle contractions, chromosomes to move

-**Transport Work**
Pumping substances across the membrane

# Summary

- **ATP** is an energy rich molecule (energy stored between second and third phosphate groups) used for many reactions and processes in cells.

- When broken, ATP releases energy and produces ADP and a phosphate group.

- ATP breakdowns are coupled with endothermic rxns to minimize energy loss. Some of the energy releases is used in endothermic rxns such as protein synthesis, muscle contractions, and nerve conduction.
