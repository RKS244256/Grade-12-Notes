Glycolysis is the **third step** in **aerobic cellular respiration** which involves **8 *cyclical* steps** and takes place in the **mitochondrial matrix**.

It's considered cyclical because **oxaloacetate**; the product of step 8; is also a reactant in step 1.

`The two acetyl-CoA molecules produced in pyruvate oxidation enter the Krebs cycle which means the cycle must happen twice per glucose molecule.`

# Key Steps

1. *Acetyl-CoA* combines with a *four-carbon compound* (*oxaloacetate*) to produce a **six-carbon compound (citric acid)**
2. The *six-carbon compound* is oxidized by *NAD<sup>+</sup>* which creates **NADH**, **CO<sub>2</sub> is also released** and leaves a **five-carbon compound**
3. Another *NAD<sup>+</sup>* is reduced into **NADH** and **CO<sub>2</sub> is released**, leaving a **four-carbon compound**
4. The *four-carbon compound* undergoes a chemical rxn which transforms it into another **four-carbon compound** and produces enough energy to join *ADP* and a *phosphate group* into **ATP**.
5. The *four-carbon compound* is oxidized by FAD, forming **FADH<sub>2</sub>**. Another *NAD<sup>+</sup>* is reduced into **NADH**. This transforms the *four-carbon compound* into **oxaloacetate**.

| Element          | Yield | Consumption | Net |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------- | --- |
| ATP              | 2     | 0           | 2   |
| NADH             | 6     | 0           | 6   |
| FADH<sub>2</sub> | 2     | 0           | 2   |
| CO<sub>2</sub>   | 4     | 0           | 4   |
**FADH<sub>2</sub>** and **NADH** carry electrons to the **Electron Transport Chain for further ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation.**
