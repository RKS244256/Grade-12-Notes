**Pyruvate Oxidation** is the **second step** in **aerobic cellular respiration** which involves **1 step** and takes place in the **mitochondrial matrix**.

# Transport

The **two pyruvates** formed via **glycolysis** are transported into the matrix.

# Pyruvate Oxidation

*Per pyruvate*
1. A **carboxyl group** from **pyruvate** is removed as **CO<sub>2</sub>** via an enzyme-catalyzed rxn. (Catalyzed by **pyruvate decarboxylase**)
2. The **pyruvate is then oxidized by NAD<sup>+</sup> producing NADH** and **an H<sup>+</sup> ion**
3. **Coenzyme-A (CoA)** (which contains sulfur), attaches to the **acetyl group** of the pyruvate, **forming acetyl-CoA**
`The bond between the carbon of pyruvate (acetal group) and sulfur of coenzyme-A is weak which will prove useful in the Krebs Cycle`.
