Organisms obtain energy via photosynthesis (photoautotrophs), organic compounds (chemoautotrophs), or by consuming glucose via other organisms (heterotrophs).

# Glucose Exothermic Redox Rxn

The exothermic redox reaction of cellular respiration is **C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> -> 6H<sub>2</sub>O + 6CO<sub>2</sub> + Energy**

Glucose stores energy in its bonds. Organisms can acquire this energy via **cellular respiration**. These bonds are broken through an **exothermic redox reaction**

C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is oxidized to 6CO<sub>2</sub> and 6O<sub>2</sub> is reduced to 6H<sub>2</sub>O. Every **carbon** in C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is converted into CO<sub>2</sub> and every **hydrogen** in C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is converted into 1/2H<sub>2</sub>O

# Combustion of Glucose

In a test tube, all energy is released as heat and light all at once.

However, in cellular respiration, cells capture energy in separate rxns with each following having a smaller activation energy.

34% of the energy obtained from the combustion of glucose goes towards ATP. The other 66% goes to heat.

# Types of Energy Transfer in Cellular Respiration

## Substrate-Level Phosphorylation

In **Substrate-level Phosphorylation**, ATP forms directly in an enzyme-catalyzed rxn. Within this enzyme, a phosphate-containing compound transfers its phosphate group directly to ADP to create ATP.

## Oxidative Phosphorylation

In **Oxidative Phosphorylation**, ATP forms indirectly through a series of enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions which involve oxygen as the final electron acceptor. These rxns harness energy and eventually transfer it to ATP.

This is done through **energy carriers (coenzymes)**.

### Energy Carriers

**Energy carriers** (aka **coenzymes**) act as electron acceptors (hence carrying energy).

**NAD<sup>+</sup>** and **FAD** are low energy, oxidized coenzymes and energy acceptors.

When reduced (electron(s) added), they become **NADH** and **FADH<sub>2</sub>**. 

`NAD+ & NADH = Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide`

`FAD & FADH2 = Favin Adenine Dinucleotide`

Reducing these molecules give the coenzymes more energy as the energy is stored in its bonds which can be eventually transferred to ATP molecules.

# Aerobic Respiration Overview

`Recap: Overall equation is:`  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> -> 6H<sub>2</sub>O + 6CO<sub>2</sub> + Energy

## Overall Goals

1. Break the bonds between the *6 carbon* atoms of glucose which would result in *6 carbon dioxide* molecules.
2. Move the *hydrogen* atoms from glucose to oxygen, forming *6 water molecules*.
3. Trap as much free energy released in the process in the form of ATP.

## Stages

1. **Glycolysis:** 10-step process which takes place in the **cytoplasm**
2. **Pyruvate Oxidation:** 1-step process which takes place in the **mitochondrial matrix**
3. **Krebs Cycle:** 8-step *cyclical* process which takes place in the **mitochondrial matrix**
4. **Electron Transport Chain (ETC):** Multi-step process which takes place in the **inner mitochondrial membrane**
