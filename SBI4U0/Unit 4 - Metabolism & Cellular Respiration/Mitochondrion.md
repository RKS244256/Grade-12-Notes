The mitochondrion is a specialized, rounded organelle found in **eukaryotic cells** which specialize in the production of large amounts of ATP.

## Structure

The mitochondria features a double membrane.

### Membranes

The first, outer membrane functions similarly to a cell membrane.

The second, inner membrane is folded (called cristae) and performs many functions related with cellular respiration.

### Inner Membrane

The second, inner membrane creates two sections within the organelle. 

**The Matrix** is filled with protein-rich fluid which fills the innermost space. Both **pyruvate oxidation** and **the Krebs cycle** take place in this matrix.

**The Intermembrane Space** is fluid-filled and describes the space between the two membranes.

### DNA

`Mitochondria possess their own DNA (mtDNA), RNA, and ribosomes, allowing reproduction.
