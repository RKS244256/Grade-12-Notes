36 ATP is only a theoretical yield due to factors such as *not all hydrogen ions re-entering through ATP synthase*, *hydrogen ions being used by other cell processes*, and *the additional cost off moving components into the mitochondria*.

As such **30 ATP** is considered the actual yield. However, the number is hard to define due to the complexities of the equations.

# Aerobic Respiration Regulation

Aerobic respiration is regulated by **feedback inhibition**.

**Phosphofructokinase** catalyzes the third rxn in **glycolysis** and is inhibited by ATP and stimulated by ADP. Essentially stops ATP production when ATP levels are high and vice versa.

**Pyruvate Decarboxylase** can remove CO<sub>2</sub> from a pyruvate molecule during pyruvate oxidation. NADH allosterically inhibits the enzyme which reduces the amount of acetyl-CoA and therefore NADH produced. A high concentration of NADH indicates the ETC is full.

# Macromolecule Digestion

Macromolecules other than polysaccharides (such as *glucose*) can be metabolized via cellular respiration. 

`Carbohydrates are the first metabolized followed by proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.`
