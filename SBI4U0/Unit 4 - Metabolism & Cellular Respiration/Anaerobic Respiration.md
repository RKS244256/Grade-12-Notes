Whilst glycolysis allows for the production of ATP (albeit very little at only 2 ATP per glucose) without Oxygen, it requires NAD<sup>+</sup> which will dwindle due to NAD<sup>+</sup> only regenerating in the electron transport chain which requires Oxygen. Organisms possess alternative methods of oxidizing NADH without the use of Oxygen.

# Fermentation

Fermentation occurs when *NADH* transfers *hydrogen ions* to items not in the *electron transport chain*.

## Ethanol Fermentation

Yeast cells perform ethanol fermentation and can be used to produce alcoholic products.

### Key Steps

1. Glycolysis produces **2 pyruvate molecules**
2. Pyruvate is broken down into **Carbon Dioxide** and **Acetaldehyde**
3. *NADH* transfers its *hydrogen atoms* to *acetaldehyde* to form **ethanol**
4. *NADH* is therefore reduced to **NAD<sup>+</sup>** and glycolysis can be continued.

`Ethanol and CO2 are released as biproducts.`

## Lactic Acid Fermentation

Occurs when muscle cells use glucose faster than oxygen is supplied.

### Key Steps

1. *NADH* transfers its *hydrogen atoms* to *pyruvate* to form **lactate** and oxidize to **NAD<sup>+</sup>**.
2. *Lactate* is transferred to the <u>liver</u>.
3. Once strenuous activity is halted, *lactate* will convert back into **pyruvate** and aerobic respiration can continue.
