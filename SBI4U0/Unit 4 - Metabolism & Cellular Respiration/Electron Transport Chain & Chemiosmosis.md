The **Electron Transport Chain** are a series of electron acceptors (aka proteins) embedded on the inner mitochondrial membrane and arranged in order of increasing electronegativity.

`The weakest attractor is NADH dehydrogenase and the strongest is cytochrome oxidase`

Because of the membrane's folded shape, there are multiple copies of the ETC across the membrane.

# Key Steps

1. *NADH* delivers its electrons to the first protein (**NADH Dehydrogenase**) in the chain. As they move through the protein, energy is released and used to pump *hydrogen ions* across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space. 
2. The *electrons* move through <u>Ubiquinone</u> (along with the ones from *FADH* which skip step one.)
3. These electrons move through <u>cytochrome bc-1</u> and <u>cytochrome oxidase</u>, both releasing energy to pump more *hydrogen ions* into the intermembrane space.
4. At <u>cytochrome oxidase</u>, the electrons are accepted by an *oxygen molecule* to form water. If not accepted, the chain will back up and no other electrons can move through the chain.
5. A protein called <u>ATP Synthase</u> allows *hydrogen ions* to travel from high concentration (intermembrane space) to low concentration (the matrix).
6. The movement of *hydrogen ions* causes <u>ATP Synthase</u> to spin and produce ATP.

`This process is aerobic due to oxygen being the final acceptor of the electrons. The production of ATP is oxidative phosphorylation`

# Regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>

Cellular Respiration requires the supply of NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD<sup>+</sup> to oxidize glucose molecules.

NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD<sup>+</sup> are both regenerated after depositing their electrons to the proteins in the *electron transport chain*.
