![](Glycolysis_Overview.png)
Glycolysis is the **first step** in **aerobic cellular respiration** which involves **10 steps** and takes place in the **cytoplasm**.

`Knowing all 10 steps is not necessary`

`TL;DR Enzymes break down glucose into 2 pyruvate, releasing ATP in the process. It does not require oxygen and is thereform anaerobic.`

# Key Steps

1. **2 ATP are consumed** in order to prime the *glucose* for splitting in the *"energy investment phase"*. The *glucose* are **phosphorylated**. This stage **yields 2 G3P molecules**.
2. **2 NADH are formed** when **G3P reduces NAD<sup>+</sup>** by adding a hydrogen.
3. **4 ATP are formed** via *substrate-level phosphorylation* during the *Energy-harvest phase* which involves the removal of 2 phosphate groups from each **G3P**.
4. **2 Pyruvates are formed** at the end of glycolysis and proceed to *pyruvate oxidation*.

# Energy Yield

*Per glucose*

| Element  | Yield | Consumption | Net |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | --- |
| ATP      | 4     | 2           | 2   |
| NADH     | 2     | 0           | 2   |
| Pyruvate | 2     | 0           | 2   |
