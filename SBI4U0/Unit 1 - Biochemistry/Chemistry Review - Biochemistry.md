## Chemistry Review/Prerequisites

## Intramolecular Bonding

The bonds within a molecule. Essentially the forces which hold a molecule together.

### Why?

Molecules form bonds in order to fulfill the *octet rule*. 
#### Octet Rule

Main group elements tend to bond in a way where they have full valence shells (hence the coined term octet rule)
### Ionic Bonding

Ionic bonds are between a **metal** and **non-metal**. This type of intramolecular bonding involves the metal losing one or more electron(s) and the non-metal gaining *n* amount of electrons from the metal.

### Covalent Bonding

Covalent bonding occurs between 2 or more non-metals. Rather than the transfer of electrons like in *ionic bonding*, electrons are shared. Atoms can either form single, double, or triple bonds. Electrons involved in this processed are called **bonding pairs**.

#### Types of Covalent Bonds

**Non-Polar Covalent Bonds** are two atoms which equally share electrons.

**Polar Covalent Bonds** are two atoms which share electrons unequally. Electrons will be pulled towards the more electronegative atom causing the resulting molecule to form positive and negative sides which allows it to interact with other molecules.

### Ionic vs Covalent

| Bond     | General Properties                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ionic    | Forms crystalline solids<br>High melting & boiling points<br>Hard & brittle<br>Soluble<br>Conducts electricity<br> |
| Covalent | Soft & squishy relative to ionic compounds<br>Lower melting & boiling points<br>Insoluble<br>Not conductive        |
## Intermolecular Forces

*Intermolecular forces* refer to forces which occur between molecules. Also known as **van der Waals forces**.

These are weaker than intramolecular bonds.
### Dipole-Dipole

Dipole-dipole refers to intermolecular forces which hold polar molecules together.

A partial +ve charge of a molecule is electrostatically attracted to the partial -ve charge of a neighbor molecule. (Opposites attract) These charges are of course formed from *polar covalent bonds*.

### Hydrogen Bonding

*Hydrogen bonds* are a stronger type of dipole-dipole bonds which only occur between Hydrogen *(H)* and Oxygen *(O)*, Nitrogen *(N)*, or Fluorine *(F)*. 

*Hydrogen bonds* are the strongest intermolecular force as Hydrogen has a small nucleus and is positively charged and Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Fluorine are very electronegative which combined, create a strong attraction.

They are easily created and easily broken.

### London Dispersion Forces

The weakest of bonds. It exists between all atoms and molecules but is more significant in *non-polar molecules*.

Electrons are constantly moving within an atom/molecule. As such, one side will be slightly more negative than the other. This can and will switch to a positive charge only an instant later, attracting another molecule.
