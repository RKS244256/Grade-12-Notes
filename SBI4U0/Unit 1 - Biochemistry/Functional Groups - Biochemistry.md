### Types of Biological Molecules

There are 5 types of biological molecules:

| Molecule      | Type      | Notes                                                            |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Water         | Inorganic | Despite not being a macromolecule, it's still essential to life. |
| Proteins      | Organic   |                                                                  |
| Carbohydrates | Organic   |                                                                  |
| Nucleic Acids | Organic   |                                                                  |
| Lipids        | Organic   |                                                                  |
#### Organic vs Inorganic Compounds

**Organic compounds** contain **Carbon** and **Hydrogen** along with other atoms such as Oxygen, Sulfur, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus.

**Inorganic compounds** lack Carbon and/or Hydrogen and are therefore not *organic*.

#### Molecule Structures

The function of a molecule is determined by its structure. This structure is determined by the **bonds between atoms** and the **overall shape of the molecule**. These unique structures are also called **isomers**.

**Note:** The bonds between organic molecules will often as reservoirs of energy. This is especially true for bonds between **Carbon** and **Hydrogen**.

### Functional Groups

Biochemically significant molecules only contain **carbon**, **hydrogen**, **oxygen**, **nitrogen**, **sulfur**, & **phosphorus**.

#### Hydrocarbons

Essentially, the base molecule is called a **hydrocarbon**. These molecules only contain *carbon* & *hydrogen* and end with "*ane*". These molecules are biologically unreactive.

##### Saturated Hydrocarbons

Saturated hydrocarbons are stable and unreactive. This  molecule contains carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms bonded to it. All covalent bonds are single and these molecules have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible.

#### Functional Groups

Organic compounds are made of **carbon** with functional groups attached in order to make them reactive and useful. Functional groups play an important role in the structure and function of a molecule. 

They can determine the features and characteristics of a molecule (for example, aminos can make a molecule more basic whereas carboxy groups can make a molecule more acidic.)

Majority of the chemical reactions within an organism involve the transfer of these functional groups to another molecule.

Common functional groups include:

### Water

Water molecules are polar covalent and is a dipole (slight negative charge on the *oxygen* and positive charge on the *hydrogen*).

#### Like Dissolves Like?

Polar dissolves polar

Nonpolar dissolves non-polar

If two substances dissolve, it's considered soluble and both are like.

#### Relevance?

Water is referred to as the universal solvent because of its polarity.

#### Properties of Water

| Properties             | Description                                                                                                                                         | Importance                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adhesion               | Water sticks to other substances quite well                                                                                                         | Allows water transport through blood and the xylem                                                       |
| Cohesion               | Water molecules can bond with other water molecules via *hydrogen bonds*                                                                            | Further aids water transport                                                                             |
| Surface Tension        | Allows water to resist external force. Water has a high surface tension.                                                                            | Allows insects and animals to walk on water                                                              |
| Solvent Properties     | Water is considered the universal solvent and is able to dissolve other molecules.                                                                  | This is important for bodily functions (such as kidney functions)                                        |
| Density                | Water, rather than contracting and becoming more dense when frozen, does the opposite. The hydrogen bonds freeze and molecules become farther away. | Allows fish and other aquatic life to survive under the surface of the water.                            |
| Specific Heat Capacity | Water has a specific heat capacity which means it requires a large amount of heat to raise its temperature.                                         | Allows fish and other aquatic life to acclimate in a stable temperature with minimal to no fluctuations. |
