### Macromolecules

**Macromolecules** are large molecules which are made up of repeating **subunits** and is often considered a **polymer** (the subunit being a **monomer**)

There are 4 main macromolecules.

| Macromolecule | Monomer Unit           |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Carbohydrates | Monosaccharides        |
| Lipids/Fats   | Fatty Acids & Glycerol |
| Proteins      | Amino Acids            |
| Nucleic Acids | Nucleotides            |
#### Forming Macromolecules

Macromolecules are formed using reactions between functional groups using their monomer units. The subunits join together with the help of their functional groups and in the process, a water molecule is removed.

**Dehydration synthesis** is the anabolic reaction which absorbs energy and forms a polymer.

#### Breaking Apart Macromolecules

Macromolecules can be broken apart using addition reactions where the polymer is broken into it's monomers by adding a water molecule. 

This process is known as **hydrolysis** and is a catabolic reaction which releases energy.
