# Chlorophyll

Photosynthetic organisms contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**. *Chlorophyll* is responsible for absorbing light and beginning photosynthesis.

There are 2 types of chlorophyll: ***Chlorophyll a*** & ***Chlorophyll b*** which differ in color and the 'R' group attached to *Chlorophyll's* **porphyrin ring**

![](Chlorophyl_Structure.png)

The R group determines which type of light energy can be absorbed by the pigment.

*Electrons within the porphyrin ring* absorb light and begin **photosynthesis**.

The **phytol chain** is a hydrocarbon chain which anchors the chlorophyll in the membrane.

# Autotrophs

## Prokaryotic

**Prokaryotic Autotrophs** thrive on **nitrogen** & **phosphate**, causing algal blooms which discolour water and may be toxic to other species.

First living organism to produce O<sub>2</sub>.

They can form symbiotic relationships with fungi in order to produce lichens.

They are closely related to chloroplast of plants as they eventually gave rise to plant cells.

## Eukaryotic

Multicellular organisms with organelles called chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll (causes green color of plants)

# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis can be represented as **6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + light energy -> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> + ATP**

Within this overall reaction, glucose and other simple sugars are formed. You may also notice it's essentially the reverse of cellular respiration.

To carry out photosynthesis:
1. Plants **must** contain chlorophyll
2. Plants **must** obtain CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and light energy 
3. Plants should contain specialized structures to aid in the efficiency of photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis** is divided into 2 parts:
1. Light reactions
2. *Calvin Cycle*

![](Photosynthesis_Overview.png)
## Light Reactions

Light reactions capture light energy and use it to make **ATP** and **NADPH**

Light reactions are divided into 3 steps:
1. Photoexcitation
2. Electron Transport Chain
3. Chemiosmosis

### Structures

#### Photosystems

Photosystems are embedded in the *thylakoid membrane* and contain chlorophyll and accessory pigments associated with proteins. 

A photosystem consists of an **antenna complex** & a **reaction centre**

Photosystems are identical except for the proteins associated with their reaction centres.

There are **2** types of photosystems:
1. Photosystem I (P700)
2. Photosystem II (P680)

`The numbers following P denote what spectrum of light is best absorbed by the photosystem`

##### Components

###### Antenna Complex

The *antenna complex* is a **web of chlorophyll and other pigment molecules.** which are embedded in the thylakoid membrane which absorbs a photon and transfers energy pigment to pigment until it reaches the *reaction centre*

###### Reaction Centre

The **reaction centre** is a transmembrane protein complex that contains ***chlorophyll-a*** and whose electrons absorb energy and begin the process of photosynthesis (starting with photoexcitation)
### Photoexcitation

Electrons in chlorophyll are at what is considered **ground state**

`Ground state is the lowest possible energy level`

**Photoexcitation** is the excitation of an atom in response to a photon which allows electrons to move away from its atom.

When a photon strikes chlorophyll (or an accessory pigment), the electrons in the pigment gain energy and are raised to a higher potential energy level which causes it to be released (*excitation*)

Excited electrons are unstable and will return to *ground state* quickly

The loss of energy created is released in the form of heat and light (**fluorescence**).

![](Photoexcitation_Overview.png)

`This is what causes the bioluminescent qualities of organisms.`

Most chlorophyll do not fluoresce as the excited electron is captured by the **primary electron acceptor**

### Noncyclic Electron Flow

2 photons strike *photosystem II* and 2 electrons from chlorophyll P680 become excited (*photoexcitation*).

The electrons are then captured by a **primary electron acceptor** and transferred through an **electron transport chain**.

Using **Z Protein**, a *water molecule* is split into **two protons**, **two electrons**, and **an oxygen**
    -> The two electrons produced by Z protein replace the ones lost in *chlorophyll P680*
	-> The two protons remain in the *thylakoid space* to form a proton gradient
	-> Oxygen leaves as a byproduct

In the *ETC*. electrons pass through a proton pump which transports protons (H<sup>+</sup>) from the **stroma** into the the **thylakoid lumen** to create a proton gradient.

The electrochemical gradient drives the **photophosphorylation** of *ADP* to **ATP**

**1 ATP forms per 4 protons** passing through ATP synthase from the **thylakoid lumen** to **stroma**

Electrons then pass into *photosystem I*.

Simultaneously, **2 photons** strike *photosystem I* and excite **2 electrons** from chlorophyll P700

`These electrons are replaced by the electrons which pass through the ETC from photosystem II`

These electrons pass through another ETC via the carrier **ferredoxin**.

*Ferredoxin* passes electrons to **NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase** which uses the *2 electrons* and a *proton* (created by Z Protein in the stroma) to reduce *1 NADP<sup>+</sup>* to **1 NADPH**

Both **ATP** and **NADPH** move to the next phase of photosynthesis

### Cyclic Electron Flow

Cyclic electron flow only utilizes **photosystem I** and generates a proton gradient for ATP synthesis.

The process only produces ATP and is a fallback when ATP is low and NADPH is high.

`For example, the ATP produced by non-cyclic electron flow may not be enough to power the Calvin Cycle. ATP is produced via chemiosmosis in both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation`

![](Cyclic_Photophosphorylation_Diagram.png)

Photons hit *photosystem I* which excites 2 electrons, which is then transported via *ferredoxin*, through the **b6-f complex** & **plastocyanin** back to the **reaction centre**. This movement creates a proton gradient which ATP synthase utilizes to create **ATP** via **cyclic photophosphorylation**.

### Cyclic vs Noncyclic Electron Flow

| Cyclic                                                      | Non-Cyclic                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only Photosystem I involved                                 | Both Photosystems are involved                                                                                                   |
| Electrons which leave the reaction centre travel back to it | Electrons from Photosystem I are accepted by NADP<sup>+</sup> whilst electrons from Photosystem II are accepted by Photosystem I |
| Only ATP produced                                           | ATP and NADPH produced                                                                                                           |
| Water is not involved/split                                 | Water is split into 2 electrons, 2 protons, and oxygen as a bypro                                                                |

### Calvin Cycle

The **Calvin cycle** occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts and is similar to the **Krebs Cycle**.

![](Calvin_Cycle.png)

It's divided into 3 phases:
1. Carbon Fixation
2. Reduction Reactions
3. Regeneration of RuBP

#### Carbon Fixation

3 *CO<sub>2</sub>* is added to *Ribulose-1-5-bisphosphate (RuBP)* to form ***6-carbon intermediates*** which are split into **3-carbon molecules**.

Carbon fixation is catalyzed by **Rubisco**

##### Alternative Mechanisms of Carbon Fixation

Rubisco can either fix CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> and cannot distinguish between the two. 

If Rubisco carboxylase fixes carbon, the Calvin cycle continues

If Rubisco oxidase fixes oxygen, Photorespiration occurs which decreases photosynthetic output due to its products not being useful in the Calvin Cycle.

There are 3 types of methods of carbon fixation with plants being categorized based on their method.

###### C3

Most plants fall into the C<sub>3</sub> category and are called such as the first compound produced in the Calvin cycle has 3 carbon atoms.

If the plant undergoes photorespiration, C3 plants lose up to one half of the carbon they fix to the process. (Hence why they do not survive well in hot/dry climates as they will lose more based on those factors)

Some plant species have created mechanisms (via evolution) in which they concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> at the sites where rubisco is found. However, C<sub>3</sub> plants generally rely on external factors to promote carbon fixation.

![](Organic_Acid_CO2_Mechanism.png)

###### C4

C<sub>4</sub> utilize a specific type of photosynthesis due to their unique leaf anatomy. 

There are two types of photosynthetic cells which house different reactions:
- Bundle-sheath cells surround veins
- Mesophyll cells surround bundle sheath cells

The separation ensures O<sub>2</sub> is not exposed to Rubisco and therefore photorespiration is avoided

![](C4_Vs_C3_Photosynthesis.png)

Furthermore, these plants utilize **PEP carboxylase** to add *CO<sub>2</sub>* to *PEP*, a 3-carbon molecule to create the 4 carbon molecule **oxaloacetate** within the mesophyll cell. It's eventually turned back into a PEP after the CO<sub>2</sub> is removed to perform the C<sub>3</sub> Calvin Cycle which occurs in the bundle sheath cells after being transferred via the plasmodesmata.

This method increases the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration within the bundle-sheath cells, allowing it to outcompete O<sub>2</sub>.

###### CAM

Succulents open and close their stomata at night and day respectively which allows it to conserve water but prevents CO<sub>2</sub> from entering during the day. 

Stomata open at night and CO<sub>2</sub> is taken in and incorporated into C<sub>4</sub> compounds using PEP carboxylase. This is called **Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM)**

These compounds are stored in vacuoles until morning when the stomata close and CO<sub>2</sub> is released into the C<sub>3</sub> Calvin Cycle

###### Differences

| Type                     | C<sub>3</sub> | C<sub>4</sub>                                           | CAM                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| CO<sub>2</sub>           | No separation | Spatially between the mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells | Temporarily during night and day |
| Stomata open             | Day           | Day                                                     | Night                            |
| Best adapted environment | Cool, wet     | Hot, sunny                                              | Very hot, dry                    |
###### Factors

Rubisco has affinities to CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.

Within normal temps (15C-25C), Rubisco has a stronger affinity to CO<sub>2</sub>. However, in higher temps, Rubisco has a higher affinity to O<sub>2</sub>.

It's also affected by abundance and concentration of both molecules due to collision theory/probability.

##### Rubisco

Rubisco (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is a large, slow enzyme which requires multiple copies to work efficiently. 

Due to Rubisco making up 1/2 of the proteins in a leaf, it's considered the most abundant protein on earth.
#### Reduction Reactions

The 6 **3-carbon molecules** are phosphorylated by ATP to form another **intermediate molecule**

*NADPH* reduces the *intermediate* to **G3P**, creating **6 G3P per 3CO<sub>2</sub>**. One G3P **leaves the cycle as a product**, leaving 5 G3P remaining in the cycle.

##### G3P

A 3 carbon sugar and the final product of the Calvin cycle.

It can either be used to regenerate RuBP, create a **glucose molecule** via **gluconeogenesis** which can then be polymerized into **starch** and stored, or moved into the cytoplasm; converted to sucrose and transported to other parts of the plant.

#### Regeneration of RuBP

*ATP* is used to rearrange the remaining *5 G3P* into **3 molecules of RuBP** which is used to fix the next 3 carbons entering the cycle.

## Leaves

![](Leaf_Anatomy.png)

Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis.

| Structure        | Function                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cuticle          | Protects the leaf from excessive light absorption and evaporation of water.                                                         |
| Epidermis Layers | Allows light to pass into the mesophyll cells where photosynthesis takes place.                                                     |
| Mesophyll Layers | Where photosynthesis takes place and where chloroplasts are most abundant                                                           |
| Guard Cells      | Creates microscopic openings called stomata                                                                                         |
| Stomata          | Regulates the exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> with the atmosphere                                                      |
| Vascular Bundle  | Transports **water** and **minerals** from *roots to leaves* and carry **carbs** produced in photosynthesis from *leaves to roots*. |
### Stomata

Stomata are microscopic openings on the surface of the bottom of the leaf. It regulates the exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> with the atmosphere.

Stomata are controlled by guard cells.
- If guard cells are turgid (filled with water), stomata are open
- If guard cells are flaccid (dehydrated), stomata are closed
Generally, they're opening during the day and closed during the night

![](Stomata_Structure.png)

#### Transpiration

**Transpiration** when water vapor is lost from plant tissues (primarily through the *stomata*). Water is pulled up through the plant from the roots due to water cohesion.

This process assists *photosynthesis* as it **moves substances from the roots to leaves** where photosynthesis occur as well as **has a cooling effect which prevents denaturation and inhibition of photosynthetic enzymes.** 

Plants will regulate stomata to maximize CO<sub>2</sub> absorption and minimize water loss.

Transpiration is promoted by **sunny, warm, dry** conditions and will also cause guard cells to reduce the size of/close stomata.

# Chloroplast

![](Chloroplast_Structure.png)

Chloroplast are made of two membranes and contain chlorophyll embedded in the thylakoid membrane.

Photosynthesis occurs in the **stroma** and **thylakoid membrane**.

The **thylakoid membrane** contains chlorophyll and electron transport chain in a structure which increases surface area and thus photosynthesis.
