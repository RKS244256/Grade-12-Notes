## Absorption Spectrum

![](Chlorophyll_.png)

Both *chlorophyll-a & b* absorb different wavelengths. *Chlorophyll-a* absorbs more red and magenta light than *chlorophyll-b*. *Chlorophyll-b* absorbs more yellow and blue light than *chlorophyll-a*.

## Action Spectrum 

![](Action_Spectrum.png)

Represents the rate of photosynthesis against each wavelength of light. It also shows which wavelength is effectively used in photosynthesis.

`In this case, red and blue light are used most effectively`

## Action vs Absorption

The **absorption spectrum** describes what spectrums of light are absorbed by a plant and how much.

The **action spectrum** shows what wavelengths are used in photosynthesis.

These graphs are easy to confuse.

# Chlorophyll And Accessory Pigments

*Chlorophyll a & b* absorb photons via wavelengths in the blue-violet and red regions whilst reflecting green wavelengths.

***Chlorophyll-a*** is the only pigment which can transfer the energy of light to carbon fixation reactions of photosynthesis. Thus it's called the **primary/principal pigment**.

*Chlorophyll-b* acts as an **accessory pigment** which absorbs light which *chlorophyll-a* absorbs poorly.

Other accessory pigments include **carotenoids**, **xanthophylls**, and **anthocyanins**.

## Seasonal Color Changes?

`During the spring and summer, leaves have a high concentration of chlorophyll and are thus green (green is reflected by chlorophyll)`

`During autumn, plants stop producing chlorophyll and thus the red wavelengths reflected by accessory pigments become visible.`
