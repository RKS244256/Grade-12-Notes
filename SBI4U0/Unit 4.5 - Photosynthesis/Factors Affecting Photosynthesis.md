It's possible to measure the rate of photosynthesis in a lab via measuring the:
1. Rate of **oxygen output**
2. Rate of **carbon dioxide uptake**
3. Rate of **glucose production**

These are not perfect measurements as the plant will also **respire** and thus take up **oxygen** and **glucose** and increase **carbon dioxide** output.

# Limiting Factors for Photosynthesis

The main factors which affect photosynthesis are:
- Light intensity
- \[CO2]
- Temperature

## Light intensity

The rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to light intensity

The more photons of light on the leaf = grater chlorophyll molecules are excited = more ATP and NADPH generation

If the intensity is extremely high, the rate may suffer as chlorophylll molecules will become damaged.

Plants have varying optimum light intensity levels which is why some plants may have to be kept in the shade.

The graph levels due to the pigments becoming saturated with light and therefore cannot take more photons of light.

### Light Compensation Point

The **light compensation point** is the light intensity in which the *rate of photosynthesis* is **equal** to the *rate of respiration*.

`CO2 uptake = CO2 output

This varies for different plants

#### Sun vs Shade Plants

*Sun plants* photosynthesize best at high light intensities.

*Shade plants* do best at light compensation point which are relatively low and do not perform photosynthesis effectively at high light intensities.

## Carbon Dioxide Concentration

Carbon Dioxide is one of the reactants of photosynthesis

The average concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is **0.04%**

An increase in \[CO2] increases the rate at which C is incorporated into G3P in light-independent reactions.

The rate will increase until limited by another factor.

## Temperature

Light independent reactions wof photosynthesis are dependent on temperature as the reactions are catalyzed by enzymes.

As enzymes approach their optimal temperature, the rate increases.

Above this optimal temperature, the enzymes may denature until they are destroyed and photosynthesis ceases as a result.

# Law of Limiting Factors

Under normal conditions, plants are subjected to multiple factors at once.

For this graph:

A & B are limited by CO2 (B is higher as it's closer to the enzyme's optimal operating temperature)

C is limited by temperature

D is limited by either temperature or CO2 as it plateaus
